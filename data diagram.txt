LEVEL-0 / CONTEXT-LEVEL FLOW
User ↔ Frontend ↔ Backend API ↔ Database
(Just to anchor everything.)

LEVEL-1 DETAILED FLOW
I’ll describe it sequentially so you can sketch it properly.

1. User Login
User → enters credentials → Frontend → sends to /api/token/
Backend → verifies credentials → pulls user record from DB → returns JWT → Frontend stores token (localStorage)

2. Display Home Page (Properties Listing)
Frontend → sends GET /rooms/ to Backend → Backend queries room + building tables → returns list
Frontend renders property cards.

3. View Property Details
User clicks a room → Frontend sends GET /rooms/<room_id>/
Backend → pulls room info, building info, availability → sends back
Frontend displays details (images, features, price, location map)

4. Rent a Room
User clicks RENT button → Frontend sends POST /rooms/<room_id>/rent/ with JWT
Backend →
• auth via JWT → get tenant_id
• validate availability
• create row in active_rentals table
• set due_date, amount
• return rental info
Frontend → redirect to “My Rentals”

5. Monthly Due Date Notifications
System (cron/scheduler) → checks active_rentals table daily
If due_date is near → insert row in notifications table
Frontend → fetches GET /notifications/
User sees reminders

6. Reports (Maintenance Issues)
User → clicks “Report Issue” → Frontend sends POST /reports/
Backend →
• link report to room or building
• store reporter_id
• save content, status (unresolved)
Admins → fetch reports GET /reports/?status=unresolved
Admins update a report PATCH /reports/<id>/resolve/
Backend sets status → resolved

7. Admin Management
Admin → creates buildings → /buildings/
Admin → creates rooms under building → /rooms/
